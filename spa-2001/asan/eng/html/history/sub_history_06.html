[Asan Chung Ju-young]
At that time, I lived in a rented room on the top of Naksan at the cost of 50 per month. 
Since we had to heat up the room, we only had hot rice during the evening, and we ate the stone-cold rice the next day in the morning. 
Small firewood back then was 10 jeon in one unit. So, it cost 20 jeon if you had to cook rice both in the morning and in the evening. But, cooking only during evening would cost 10 jeon, making it possible to save 300 won per month. That is how we saved money. There was a tram back then. 

We had a bus, too. It cost 5 jeon for the tram, but I never got on a tram because I wanted to save 5 jeon. So, my shoes would wear out fast. What I did was to apply tire leather on the sole; shoes lasted longer. 

Anyway, I don’t smoke now, not because of money, and I didn’t smoke back then, too. I didn’t smoke because it was a waste of money. Why would I waste my money by smoking when I was not full enough? So, I didn’t smoke. I don’t smoke now because it is said to negatively affect health.  

Dabang, a coffee shop back then, was a place for rich people. It was not a place for blue collar workers. We have many blue collar workers in Hyundai Heavy Industries.  

I always tell them. Why would you need a TV before you have your own house? It would just be a burden when moving to another rented house. You know what is going in the world only with a radio, and in fact, radio has more to tell. And, why would you waste money at a Dabang just by drinking something that does not keep you full? Eat udong with the money you spend at a Dabang. That is what I really recommend to people. 

We got a small rented house, then a moved to a bigger one. After moving from place to place, we bought a house with the money saved. There is this area called Hyeonjeo-dong across from Seodaemun Prison. There were small houses at the tip of the mountain, which are now torn apart and gone. We bought a thatch-roofed house.  It may have been the first house sent from heaven because it was located at the highest tip of the mountain. 

When I was a rice delivery boy in Seoul, I wanted to be a lawyer. I thoroughly read “Soil” a novel by Lee Kwang-soo, published in Dong-a Ilbo. At that time, I wanted to become like Huh Soong in the novel and help uneducated people. So, I bought this Legal Journal and studied law. 

According to the proposal by us, by Hyundai, what we said was that we were not selling ships we made to  Koreans in order to pay back  debts, but we were selling them to the ship owners in other countries and getting profits to  pay  debts since Korean ship owners do not have money. Then a foreigner asked why would a person buy a ship from a company like Hyundai which has never produced a ship before? 

He told us to bring proof that there is somebody who will order a ship from Korea and by  Hyundai, a place where  a ship has never been produced. With the proof, he could get confirmation from the Vice-Minister. 

We were confronted with a big problem. Well, shifting the position, he was smart though. He was reasonable. Then, we went to Livanos, the brother-in-law of the tycoon Onassis.  

Well, even now, it is a pathetic thing. It was not that we had a dockyard. We just brought him a map of a 50,000 pyeong sized site and a picture of the white beach where we were planning to build a dockyard. We brought him those materials, and said that we needed the proof that you were buying our ship, and then we will get confirmation from the British Vice-Minister that permits us to buy machinery. Then, we will build the dockyard, and give you profits increased by four-folds. So, buy it. 

Some said we were all talking nonsense, not knowing they were even more foolish. But, Livanos was persuaded by us. He contracted for two ships of 260 thousand tons each. He deposited approximately USD 37 million twice, totaling to KRW 70 million. So, out of the deposit money, we got KRW 1.3 billion and sent it overseas. With the proof and the contract signed, we got the British Vice-Minister’s confirmation. 

We can’t always have an easy life; there are many difficult sides to  life. However, all these difficulties can be overcome. That’s what I think. 

When we run a business, many people will think how is it possible for someone to run so many businesses? But, I think there is nothing difficult in running a business nor is there difficulty in life. That’s the way I think. 

I would say only wars will put one’s life in difficulty. I am not a soldier. But, when I refer to those past people that took up at least a small portion in the history of the world, like Napoleon who dominated everything in Europe, every character in “Samgukji” of the Three Kingdoms period in China and the stories told about the warring times during the Korean wars, I realize nothing else but that war is the difficult part in life. That is what I believe in life.  

Then, why is war the most difficult part in life? During wartime, so many followers and staffs get killed, and your life is at risk, too. 

There is nothing similar in a company. Although how much we work, how much we stay overnight and go overseas, we do not get killed. We can rethink over again tomorrow what we could not resolve today. We can also devise a winning plan tomorrow with a secured life for the game that we may have lost today8. 

Except for war, there is nothing difficult in life. Our country’s future will be secured and will develop even further regardless of the difficulties that may come due to trade barriers. That is something I am can say with certainty.

You, as students, should have a level of certainty about your future. 

In our society, as long as you are not disabled, you have been blessed to be born in this country that has four distinct seasons. So, our future will surely be bright, joyful and happy, and there is no such thing as difficulty, sadness or sorrow. That is what I think. 

What I believe is that each human being sets an objective and paves a way for improvement in accordance with such situation he/she is put into. The auto industry is a good example. You are at the heart of this semiconductor industry. You have seen the technology developed in the U.S., right? They fly this rocket to the moon and they come back. 

This Columbia aircraft flies around the globe and puts up satellites to collect telecommunication charge, right? In addition, Japan is said to surpass the U.S. in some of the computer technology parts. What is Korea doing? What will you do when you are such a slow starter? That is how they view it. But, don’t get disappointed. 

Then, what shall we do? The problem is not catching up with them who are far ahead of us. We are not chasing after them; but, we are starting from the point they are at. The leading group in the same line. The great powers. That is what we are studying. That is why we do not have to be discouraged at the fact that they are far ahead of us. 

All businessmen are alike. An enterprise is a society. You don’t think you are a loser because you suffer losses. It is not that you are a loser because you are confronted with obstacles and go bankrupt as long as you think you can always win. You become a loser when you throw in the towel. That is how we think as businessmen. 

Hosting the Olympics, s many argue, may leave much debt that can be a burden to our descendants and not many advantages may follow. That is why the government has an in depth study and went through a series of disputes, and finally made the decision to host it. But, it does not mean that the hosting of Olympics will just come naturally because we decide to host it. 

At that time we were in competition with Japan in Baden-Baden. Overcoming the obstacle of our financial situation, we won it. There are countries that successfully leverage the Olympics to make improvements in the economy and culture, while there are some that just take in huge debts. 

All the results depend on how the people in the country unite together and how the leaders and people come into agreement to take advantage of such an opportunity. The Olympics, for sure, will be  a turning point in every respect for  Korea, including the economy and culture. It surely will help us make a great leap forward. We do not forecast debts, but we do forecast great profits either. 

I am not sure whether I will go on for another 10 or 20 years running a private enterprise. I will go as far as I can as long as I have interest in it. Also, farming in Seosan is a personal matter, and there is no definite term to this, as I will do farming as long as my limbs can move. 

We never say we failed due to an obstacle in business. There are times when we are successful and when we are unsuccessful. For those things that we could not be finished today may be accomplished tomorrow, right? 
 
Everyone should have been surprised at the fact that we beat Japan for the Olympics bid. We have achieved an economic miracle. That is a miracle. That is reality. Such has not been made by a miracle but by efforts. All the members were to vote once, and the time was very short. From that experience, I learned something important. I became certain that there was nothing we could not achieve if we were to unite. 

What I think is the most important part in life is the workplace. Improvements in humans can be made in education institutions, but humans   improve even more in everyday life. The workplace is critical for it gives us a salary, but it is important as well because it stimulates improvement in man. Isn’t this how everyone views a workplace? That is, social stability, workplace stability and politics stability are all interconnected. 

The members that make up the workplace are very important. Not only at the workplace, but also in a general gathering of over four people, I try to seek meaning and try to pursue a position that can help everyone surrounding myself. I believe that the more proper-thinking, hardworking people there are that can be an exemple to others, our country, society and workplace will succeed even more.  

Now, the role of an enterprise does not end in one’s advancement in life or in the company. But, it will bring about national development, social development and the industrial development in the relevant field. That is how I view it. 

So what I tell all the young people is that if you want to become a top-notch entrepreneur of a top-notch enterprise, then have some patriotism. Those who do not have a sense of patriotism cannot run a big business nor can they develop a business that can be loved by the people and society. 

Those who only aspire for a certain chance with their own wits and tricks would compromise with evil spirits to stand out. So, for those who want ongoing improvement of a company and to become the long lasting leader of such group, I would say they need to get patriotism first. That is how I put it. 

I believe that the Koreans can succeed in cutting edge technology. We are digging into various cutting-edge technology industries such as semi-conductors. Although we may fall behind others in terms of technology, we are close to Japan and similar to the U.S. and Europe in terms of production volume. You can put it that way. So, if the government and all companies collaborate together to develop technology, we can accomplish high standard development and high production volume. That is what I think.  

Just refer to the eight consecutive wins at the Skills Olympics and the passion for studies among youngsters, as well as the parents’ passion for their children’s studies. Our people, rooted in a five thousand year long history of strong cultural identity, have innate intelligence. For this reason, I believe that if all our entrepreneurs and leaders from economy, politics and society take aggressive measures, we will become the sturdy beacon that lights up the future of Asia in the 2000s’. That is what I believe in. 

If our people have more integrity, more devotion and more consideration to help others instead of troubling them, and attempt to become pioneers of the future, we will develop  into a country that everyone will envy. 

I hope that everyone reflects on their actions and works hard for the future with a sense of dignity.

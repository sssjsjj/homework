[Asan Chung Ju-young]
In our lives, I believe that everything is difficult and there  nothing is  easy. However, everything can be overcome. 
When my father came to pick me up when I arrived in Seoul for the first time, he brought me to a zoo.. It was 10 jeon for an adult and five jeon for a child. My father, valuing 10 jeon, told me to go inside the zoo alone because he already saw a tiger in his hometown. 

[Narration] 
You never blamed your fate nor have you wished for luck. 
[Asan Chung Ju-young] 
All humans are given equal amounts of good and bad luck a by the Creator. The successful people take advantage of their good luck and leverage it even further by cleverly overcoming times of ill luck and eventually connect good timing with good luck. 

[Narration] 
You just plodded away at your job. 

[Asan Chung Ju-young] 
The dream maybe big, but everyday life may be hard; people like us will pant just by looking at the peak of the mountain and may get hurt by missing a step. So, when you just steadily move footstep by footstep, you may find yourself at the peak. 

[Narration]
You claimed that there may be a trial but no failure. On this very bare land, you have invented a car that will travel around the globe in the future. You said that those who think they can do anything will do everything; so, you have eventually made a ship on our sea. The roads that you built have now become part of our daily life and you, who had a heart even hotter than the sun, constructed miracles in various parts of the Middle East. 

With measures that no others can even imagine, you made a land on sea, and you initiated a dream that ran from melted iron to an automobile. You successfully made it possible for Korea to host the '88 Olympics Games that everybody said was impossible and elevated Korea into a position of a leading country. 


[Asan Chung Ju-young]
[I won after overcoming obstacles. I believed that the ’88 Olympics Games will surely become a great stepping stone for Korea to improve.] 

[Narration]
You made all possible efforts as the leader of the economy for 10 years. You have shown limitless affection towards the future of this country, held the hands of people in pain and embraced the world in your big chest. What has made you make such commitments? 

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
When I retire from my work, I want to be recognized as a person who was fully committed to our society. For that, I will make  allpossible efforts. 

[Narration]
You have achieved many things even when people were not encouraging. You have spent your whole life dedicating yourself to poor neighbors and this country. We now call you, 
“The Creator that Pioneered Our Time”

You were the creator of our time, you were our brother and you were our father. We are so glad that we can cherish memories of you. You paved the road with sincerity without even resting in the shade. Can we now follow you and walk along the way?

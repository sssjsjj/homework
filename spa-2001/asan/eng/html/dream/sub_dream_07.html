EPISODE MOVIE7
Open up a New Path
Find and create Where There’s None

Can’t find your way?
“if you can’t see where to go, find a way.”
“if there is no way, create a way.”

Chung Juyung was a maker of the first of many roads.
He was called the tiger on site.

The story of the two ‘ways’ he created.

The story of the first ‘way’
The accumulation of experience and technology 
is known as intangible property.

The 1960s.
The government leads domestic construction.
Investment hits a wall.
During the crisis of the construction industry,
he chose to take up another challenge.

“Let’s go abroad and find a way to succeed!”
Chung Juyung

1965
Competed with 16 advanced corporations.

Through endurance and boldness, 
he won a contract to build
The Pattani – Narathiwat Highway, Project of Thailand. 

Carrying the expectations of the people and nation on his back. 
Chung Juyung began Hyundai’s first overseas expansion.

But there was not a single highway in Korea at that time.
There was no overseas construction experience in the  nation.
It wasn’t easy to go abroad.

Constant rain, lack of technology
Snowballing construction expenses

“Though we may suffer a loss of money, it must be done
for our country, not just for our company.”
Chung Juyung

Finally, through Korea’s own technology
The first overseas construction was completed.

This led on entries into other countries
Vietnam, USA(Alaska & Guam), Papua New Guinea, the Middle East, etc.

And another ‘way’
built on this invaluable experience

The second ‘way’ story

Build the Gyeongbu Expressway.
Minimize costs and time required.

The territory’s main artery
The largest construction in the country’s history
A national adventure

428km from Seoul to Busan
“Make it within 3 years.”

On February 1, 1968, work began
Adhering to the tight deadline was the biggest challenge.

The key to reduction was mechanization.
He introduced 1,989 heavy machines.
9 million staff worked on it each year.

The most difficult problem was the Dangje Tunnel.
At the Okcheon worksite, it links Daejeon and Daegu.

It was hard to go forward just 2m per day.
The soil kept collapsing, and the walls kept caving in.

“It’s impossible to beat the clock!”

“I disagree.
Though it is expensive,
Let’s put in cement that hardens 20 times more quickly!”

The construction was supposed to require 3 months.
It took only 25 days.

Finally
July 7, 1970

At 2 years and 5 months,
it was the shortest period in world of construction.
The 428km Gyeongbu Expressway was open.

1970
3.68 million cars used it per year.
40 years later
380 million cars have used it.

Gyeongbu Expressway
A steppingstone for national economic development
the main artery of industry and national life

“There is no success without effort in this world.
You need to pay the price for the adventure of great development.”
Chung Juyung

Can’t find your way?
“if you can’t see where to go, find a way.
If there is no way, create a way.”
Chung Juyung

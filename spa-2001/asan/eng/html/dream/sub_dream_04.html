Think Differently
A Ship That Can Float Can Also Sink

[Newspaper]
Korea was surprised!
Sea area 33 times the size of Yeouido had been reclaimed as national land.

A great historical event that changed the map of the Western Korea.
The reclamation project of Cheonsu Bay in Seosan.

“The wider, the better.
Let’s extend this land a little more to pass on to our descendents
And become self-sufficient for food!”
Chung Juyung

[Newspaper]
The world was amazed.
The construction of Chung Juyung’s cofferdam was unprecedented.

Q. How did you come up with such a brilliant idea?

“Everything sprang from the moment of crisis.”
Chung Juyung

1984
The last stage of the cofferdam construction
Used reclaimed land from Cheonsu Bay, Seosan.

Severe difference between situations of high and low tide.
Force strong enough to break a duck’s legs.

Sea wall construction in Zones A and B
Extended over a total 7,700m.
In one year, 2.35 million construction workers were employed.

514,300 truckloads of sand and stone were poured into the sea.

Finally only 270m remained.

This was the most difficult part of the construction

A torrent of 8m per second.
“no matter how much stone we pour, it still won’t work!”

The torrent sweeps away everything immediately.
Even a 4.5 ton car-sized rock is no match.

The brilliant idea in the heat of the crisis	

Water Bay, an unused tanker anchored in Ulsan Harbor.
A ship can float
It can also sink.

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
Final formation was somewhat difficult for us. So, we bought a ship that disassembles oil tanker of 250 thousand tons with scrap iron. We put water in to  sink it during formation. 

February 25, 1984
Chung Juyung’s method of construction began.

320m long, 45m wide and 27m high.
A 226,000 ton mega oil tanker
towed from Ulsan Harbor to the coast at Seosan.

Yet, the tidal forces were too great.
The oil tanker was pushed out from the sea wall.

Chung Juyung jumped onto the ship.
He took the helm himself.

“We need to fill it with 16,000 tons of water within an hour to sink it!”
They struggled with the rough seas for 24 hours.

Finally the ship was completely submerged.
Sand and stone were poured down on both sides of it at the same time.

Chung Juyung’s method of construction
Had succeeded!

A tremendous historical event
It redrew the map of Korea.
Wider than Gimje Plain.
The period of construction was reduced by three years.
Saved construction expenses totaling 29 billion won.

Desire of the self-sufficiency for food.
The gift from a son to his father who was a farmer.

“It’s belated present for my father.
He worked the land all his life.
His fingernails were worn down from working the rocky fields.”
Chung Juyung

A creative idea
Turning a crisis into an opportunity.

“Think before you act.
Then you can do 10 times, 100 times-
More work than other people.”
Chung Juyung

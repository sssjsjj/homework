No End to the Challenge
Dreams of Molten Metal for Generations

There were countless challenges
Before dreams came true, became reality.

In January 6, 2010
Hyundai Steel Company produced its first molten metal
at the blast furnace of the integrated steelworks in Dangjin.

Integrated steelworks are
Where iron melts in the blast furnace to produce molten metal.

“Making iron is at the center of industry.
When this ability increases,
Key industries will grow and solidify,
strengthening national competitiveness.”
Chung Juyung

“For greater competitiveness,
a private corporation should enter
into the steel industry.”
Chung Juyung

1978
Hyundai Group expanded into the steel industry
Through a merger with Incheon Iron Manufacturing.
The first step in a dream full of molten metal!

In 1978,
he applied for a second steelworks,
but his application met with rejection.

“Through aggressive targeting of world markets
Japan installed more iron making facilities
and continued investing in the idea of ‘iron attracting iron.’”
Chung Juyung

“We can do it!”
In 1994, due to concerns of oversupply.
the second attempt to build
a steelworks failed again.

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
Once you admit that you have failed, you’ve really failed.
When you always think that you can succeed, I believe you’re living a winning life.
 
“Challenges never end!”
In 1996, due to the financial crisis,
the third trial to build
an integrated steelworks was held back.

Falls 3 times and rises again.

Hyundai Motor Group took over Hanbo Steel in 2004
And drove forward a private steelworks
With a 12 million-ton blast furnace.

In October, 2007
Hyundai Steel started building
An integrated steelworks in Dangjin.

In January 5, 2010
blast furnace No.1 lit up
In April 8, 2010
an integrated steelworks was completed.

A 32-year-long dream for molten metal.
The indomitable spirit of challenge
Generation after generation.

“First failure is your medicine.
Second failure makes you strong
Third failure is applause
For your future success”
Chung Juyung

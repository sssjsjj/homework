EPISODE MOVIE 9
A Philosophy of Hope in Life
Work Hard Every Day and Find no difficulties in the World

“The progress of mankind has been driven by those who have thought positively.
There are so many things that can be done by those who see the world clearly and brightly for society.”
Chung Juyung


[Narration]
When I ran a small store, I never thought of myself leading a big enterprise in Korea, not even in my dreams. I just lived every day doing my best, and that is how my shop became big. I did not have any sense about it being a big enterprise. 

I take pride in myself that I am an extremely rich man after overcoming xtreme difficulties. 

In times of extreme obstacles or troubles, I have never felt I am a troubled man, nor I am a poor man in pain. Although I was poor, I always had presence of mind. 

The cool breeze that I felt in the shade after long hours of hard labor during a scorching summer day is something that only those heavy who have engaged in hard toil can know and feel. Only they could feel the cool happiness. People can still feel happy despite such hardships because they have a presence of mind. The obstacles or pains are in one’s mind, not in  reality. 

Frugality means storing up wealth
to accomplish more meaningful work

“It’s more important to live in a way that has a good influence on others 
than to enjoy good food, clothing and shelter.”
Chung Juyung

He was the oldest son of eight children from a poor farmhouse.
He only graduated elementary school.
At age 19, he left his house with nothing in his pocket
heading out for physical labor.

Quickly known for his sincerity and trust, he took the reins at rice shop.
He founded Hyundai, the world renowned group.

“Only a person who had worked in the hot weather knows
what happiness is found in the shade.”
Chung Juyung	

“Work is the blessing God has given to human beings.”
Belief in the sanctity of labor

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
I have never got on a tram. I saved 5 jeon instead. 
I applied a piece of tire on the shoes sole. So they lasted long. 


[Narration]
I believe the most critical part in life is positive thinking. Believing that everything is possible can resolve anything.
From the past up until now, I wake up before five because I am so excited and happy to do what has been given to me for the day. 

I always say that people need to be diligent, have a sense of honor and be clean. 
If a person asks if there is a watchword in our family,  diligence would be the answer. 


Diligence is the true etiquette of life

If you work hard every day, there is no hardship that you cannot overcome.
If you’re diligent, there is no difficulty in the world.

His father was a traditional father of a big family.
He insisted on educating him at the dining table.

Calling himself a rich laborer, he spent his life
working alongside technicians and workers.

“Hierarchical distinctions belong at work. 
Such high and low distinctions have no place in people.”
Chung Juyung

[Narration]
Not only at the workplace, but also in a general gathering of people, I try to seek meaning and try to pursue a position that can help everyone surrounding myself. 

I am always satisfied, happy and positive with what is given to me even in the past when I had nothing or in the present. 
Some say that those who are rich are unfortunate because they may face internal conflicts to desire more. I am quite short of schooling, so I just go with the flow. If there is not enough of such and such, I just live with it, and if there is more, I just live with it as well. Those that can put up with their current environment can always feel satisfied and happy. 


Philosophy of hope by Chung Juyung

“There are various type of lives; busy, free or etc.
What they live for, I think their ultimate desire is just one thing.
Finding inner peace and satisfaction in their lives.”
Chung Juyung

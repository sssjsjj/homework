He is the most localized, yet most globalized man of the 20th century. 
Documentary “Asan Chung Ju-young”

[Narration]
The numerous challenges and legends that Asan has created have promoted Hyundai to become a global company and developed Korea into an economic giant. Now, Asan is moving towards taking on the role of building a bridge between the South and North and being a mediator for peace. We call the person that confronts trials and creates his own fate a “pioneer”. That is who Asan is. Asan Chung Ju-young, a solid base that supported our era, was the pioneer of our era who never hesitated or turned back.  


In June 1998, Asan stood in front of Panmunjom, which is the symbol of the last divided country in the world, with his “Tongil (unification) cattle”.. It was the first civilian to cross the Panmunjom and visit North since the division. Asan led the magnificent 900 m long parade of the cattle towards the territory that has been longed for by many but which cannot be entered. The national flags waved with high hopes. The drama of such a moment was how Asan succeeded in attracting the world’s attention towards the peninsula once again. 


Going beyond division to peace 

Asan, who revisited the North with 501 heads of cattle, met with Kim Jong-il, the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and successfully drew up an agreement for the development of Mt. Kumkang  and the western coast industrial complex. Through economic cooperation, Asan opened the gates for the nation’s reconciliation and peace. On November 18, 1998, hope filled the Cruise Kumkang and lit up the East Sea as it sailed towards Mt. Kumkang with 1,420 passengers and cabin crew. It was the moment that signaled the beginning of unification. 

After a 12 long hour trip, everybody stepped on Mt. Kumkang and a 50 long year dream come true for a moment and nobody could speak a word due to the overwhelming joy. A new chapter dawned in the history of Korea when the South and North embraced and the memories of hometown were remained vivid. 

Cruise Kumkang, Bongrae and Pungak. With these three cruises heading to Mt.. Kumsang everyday, Mt. Kumkang has now become the nation’s favored tourist site. The region is now rising as a new tourist attraction globally after foreigners were given permission to visit. 

Asan’s passion for the nation’s reconciliation stretches to the South and North’s interaction in sports. The first fruit is “Pyeongyang Hyundai Asan Chung Ju-young Stadium”, which will be built in collaboration between the South and North. What did Asan think when he shoveled for the first time at the stadium on which his name has been inscribed? He surely looked forward to promoting reconciliation and cooperation between the two halves of the nation.  

Asan looked very happy when he attended the first and second round of the unification basketball game held in Pyeongyang and Seoul, which was a place of reconciliation and interaction. The players on the court were real brothers and sisters who transcended ideology. 


Together with the lonely neighbors 

Asan Chung Ju-young, a son of poor peasants, has been thrifty throughout his life. For that reason, he paid unceasing attention towards the less privileged who were did not enjoy the fruits of rapid industrial growth. 

In 1977, Asan decided that he would donate his wealth to these unprivileged ones. Then, he took 50% of the Hyundai Engineering & Construction to establish the Asan Foundation, aiming to rescue people from diseases and poverty. Asan built modern general hospitals in rural areas across the country and provided various medical benefits such as free medical services and medical tours. In addition, he aggressively conducted various social welfare support businesses for the less privileged. 

Moreover, he has conducted various academic support projects including research and development support business for talented scholars and educational support programs for teenagers of low income families. Through such activities, Asan has contributed magnificently to society. 


The legend of Baden-Baden: Hosting ’88 Seoul Olympics Games 

The hosting of the ’88 Olympics was something that everyone thought would be impossible by claiming that Seoul would only receive about three votes out of 82 votes. However, the result was very dramatic when 52 votes were garnered. Asan, who chaired Korea’s Bidding Committee for the ’88 Seoul Olympics, made every possible effort. He then finally succeeded in being invited to host the Olympics by defeating Nagoya of Japan. 

The 24th Olympic Games Seoul 1988 was one of the most successful games and was attended by 14,000 people from 160 countries, and it was an occasion that raised the country’s global position and profile. In addition, with Soviet Union and most North Eastern countries participating in the event, the Seoul Olympics was an occasion that helped bring the Cold War to an end and contributed to the peace policy making between North Eastern Asian countries. It was truly a festival of global reconciliation. 



Political engagement

In the new year of 1992, Asan, who had desired to overcome the pains of division and advance the nation, established a new political power base under the banner  of a unified Korea and economic development. Asan-led Unification People Party insisted on the abolition of unnecessary policies that were made due to improperness, gaining the country’s fervent support and response. 

During the general election held only after 50 days since its formation, he succeeded in winning enough seats to have a legislative bargaining position in the National Assembly, shaking up  politics. However, in December of the same year, Asan’s dream to contribute to the country’s development as President was not fulfilled. Though another trial, Asan was not discouraged. Such trials made him and his passion for unification even stronger. 

 
A prominent figure in the 20th century 

Asan Chung Ju-young spent more time in nongovernmental diplomacy at national levels. In 1989, Asan was the first civil entrepreneur to visit the Soviet Union; then, he undertook a decisive role in opening the way  to mutual economic cooperation between Korea and the Soviet Union and advanced the friendship between the two countries. That is why the world does not just remember Asan only as a businessman. 

Recently, a business weekly in Hong Kong named Asan among the 10 top figures of the 20th century in Asia. Asan is a symbolic figure in the history of Korea’s economic growth who has often met with the leaders of foreign countries. He met with a number of leaders in other countries including President Reagan of the U.S., Prime Minister  Thatcher of England, Prime Minister Takeshita of Japan and President Jiang Zemin of China, elevating the position of Korea in the world. 


The legendary leader of the Korean economy 

Asan’s ongoing growth and overcoming of trials are the history of Hyundai, as well as the record of the Korean economy’s growth and restoration. Hyundai is now the symbol of Korean technology that elevates national prestige . 

The Korean War totally ruined Korea. But, Asan, in his desire for reconstructing his homeland, aggressively partook in the restoration business of Hangang Bridge and became the leading actor that accomplished the miracle on the Hangang.  Hyundai’s achievement – overseeing national businesses including shipbuilding, industrial plants and steel production to the service industry as well as automobiles, construction, electronics and finance services - is the fruit of Asan’s entrepreneurship and courage in the face of many trials. 


From the impossible to the possible 

Ulsan Port, which was a silent sea village, has now turned into a complex of bulky buildings. This is a landscape drawn by Hyundai Heavy Industries, which is the world’s top shipbuilding company. Entering the 70s’, Asan recognized the importance of heavy industries. Asan was sure that it would be possible to build a massive shipbuilding site with accumulated construction experiences and relevant technology. 

Nobody would bet on his success when he put forward this this plan with only a  picture of Mipoman shore. Finally in June 1974, the legend of Mipoman was realized. The tale of Hyundai Mipo’s completion of a dockyard and two ships in two years and three months has passed into legend . 

There is no limit
He displayed great tenacity to develop the automobile industry and make it part of the  long term development of the country. Such enthusiasm and passion of Asan led to the foundation of Hyundai Automobile Company. Not only that, Asan plunged himself into the gigantic plan to develop Korean-made cars. 

He firmly believed that Korea-made cars were one of the key ways to gain a competitive edge and to survive in the global market. Hyundai introduced the Pony, the country’s first car in January 1976, and it has now become a global automobile company that has the world’s largest production site and has established full line up system, exporting to 190 countries worldwide. 
In accordance with Asan’s prediction for the future of the country, Hyundai Automobile has now entered the global market. 
 

From heavy industries and consumer-oriented manufacturing businesses to sophisticated technology, 
Asan’s belief that the future of the Korean economy depended on high value added sophisticated technology industries led to the foundation of Hyundai Electronics in 1983. The world was skeptical  that Asan could ever succeed. 

But to everyone’s surprise, just as  Asan forecasted and determined , Hyundai Electronics developed itself into one of the world’s best semi-conductor companies by developing 64 mega D ram, 256 mega SD ram and 1 giga D ram. Although the company was a latecomer, it became a  top notch firm thanks to its sophisticated technology. 


Becoming a global company through the construction business

Asan led large scaled construction projects such as the Gyeongbu Express Way, Soyanggang dams, as well as many roads, bridges, dams and plants. Based on the experiences he had obtained locally, Asan opened up overseas market for the first time in the history of the local construction industry. Starting in Thailand and moving to the Middle East in the 70s’, there was no country where Asan could not go and no dream he could not realize. 

At that time, Asan partook in various authorized construction projects such as Jubayl Port construction, which is said to be the largest engineering construction in the 20th century, and played a decisive role in restoring the Korean economy that was on the brink of a huge crisis. 

Persistence and belief that changed the map 
When you enter Busung-myun, Seosan-gun in Northern Chungchung, which is in the middle of the peninsula, you will come across a vast field. It is Seosan farm which was created by the son of poor peasant, Asan, who pushed away all the opposition with his persistence and strong belief. 

In February 1984, Asan began reclaiming land in the western sea shore. Asan created a total of 47 million pyeong of farmland by reducing construction costs and expenses by adopting his unique and original method, which is also called the “Chung Ju-young way.” A land filled with strong belief and persistence; there, Asan stood on a land that he recreated with his strong will. 

Who would have known that Seosan farmland and Cheonsuman would become the place where the highest number of migratory birds flockto,  disproving the  claim that the ecosystem will be ruined if the sea water is blocked. 

Asan Chung Ju-young, based on his superb business management skills, has been recognized not only for his contribution to national development but for generating mutual prosperity with  other countries. 

He was conferred with so many awards and medals both inside and outside the country, and they include the IOC Medallion and Norwegian Royal Family awards. 

Many of the world’s reputable schools including John’s Hopkins University and George Washington University have given honorary doctorates to Asan, whose education background was elementary school graduation. 

They, in fact, have acknowledged the numerous achievements and contributions Asan has made as an entrepreneur. In addition, the Heritage Foundation of the U.S. established and conducts a Chung Ju-young Fellowship program. 		

The leader of our time who realized our dreams

Asan Chung Ju-young, who is a legend and leader of his  era,  opened up the way to prosperity for us. The moments that he has pioneered are the history of the Korean economy and the history of the country’s prosperity. Now, Asan is set to establish a new chapter in the history of the country through the unification and reconciliation of the country by acting as a bridge between the South and North and a mediator for peace.

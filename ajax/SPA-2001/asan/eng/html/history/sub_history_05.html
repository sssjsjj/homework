Asan Chung Ju-young

It feels good when you have something good and you promote it to become even better. But, you feel best when you resolve something difficult.  So, until now, I wake up any time before five full of joy and excitement for I have something to do and accomplish. 

[Narration] 
A great man has gone. 
Asan Chung Ju-young, a great man of our time who unceasingly guided and enlightened us for the past 86 years, is now gone. 
Everyone tried to grab his arms; but, with the time flowing that nobody could stop, he has passed away. 

The pioneer
The leader of this era 
The great man that has created a legend 
That is how you have been named by us. 
And we remember. 
The enterprising spirit and indomitable mind of yours, and the steps that you took that were ahead of their time and led the way forward.  

In a legendary tale of a poor mountain boy of Gangwon becoming the globally renowned entrepreneur, you have shown us there is nothing impossible if one has integrity, diligence and creativity. 

From development of steel structures to the cutting edge technology automobile industry, you, Asan Chung Ju-young, were the pioneer of the era and the developer of this country who created something big from nothing. 
You were the living proof of our past and you were the living history of our times. 

All the achievements you accomplished would not have been possible if it weren’t for you.
You led one thousand cattle to North Korea to realize the nation’s long cherished desire for unification and tear apart the barrier that divided the country. 
You brought the attention of the world to this divided peninsula and put down stepping stones for harmony for peace between the South and North.
We are now set to walk along the road that you have paved. 

We will cultivate the tree of unification, which has sprouted from the seeds that you sowed. 
Korea, a small country in East Asia back then, has now grown into a world power with your leadership. 
Asan, you have developed in every aspect by continuously searching for new tasks without being satisfied with current achievments. 
You were the great man of our time. .
You were the nation’s pioneer and patriot that made the world realize the potential capability of this country. 

Sometimes strict and sometimes generous, Asan Chung Ju-young, you were the Father of our times. You have always shared the pains and difficulties of your neighbors in a sincere manner and with your thrifty practices. 

You always strived to make this world better for everyone and open up the opportunities for further hopes. 
Asan Chung Ju-young, you were the constructor of this country, you were the bridge-builder of the century and you were the cornerstone that supported our era. 

You, leaving all the people’s sadness for the loss, rest in peace. 

Asan, we sincerely promise you in front of your portrait that we will follow in your footsteps. 

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
I believe that positive thinking is the most important thing  in our lives.
I believe that believing nothing is impossible will resolve any situation.

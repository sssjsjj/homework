		"content":"Anybody can have both bad and good luck at the same time. Luck is really just time; hence, good luck is, in fact, the time you have to enjoy your work. To those who work hard and refuse to miss out on good luck, there is no hole through which bad luck can flow. <br />It’s a general rule that those who claim to have bad luck are actually just lazy. I think my efforts have given me good luck and want to emphasize that such good luck tends to accrue more among those who are diligent."

My reply never changed : “When you want to do something, financial limitations never stop you. If you believe in what you want to do, and you trust what you do, everything will follow naturally. How can money be a problem if you are doing the right thing, and it’s something you like to do? Believe in what you do, and others will believe in it as well. "

		"content":"Iron resolve and the spirit of adventure are not the only ingredients to success. Far from it. There must also be close introspection and conviction to back those up. Others say Hyundai is a company of adventure. But, this is not the case. It is simply that, of all its myriad of different interrelated enterprises, none has failed. Though it may seem to those on the outside that Hyundai simply jumps into something without foresight, the fact is, failure is a foreign word at Hyundai precisely because we back our resolve with close introspection and firm conviction.

Get the personnel right, and the rest of the corporation will just fall into place.<br />All new hires want to work at energetic companies and energetic departments. But if, when they get there, they find their superiors are exhausted, then not only will the new hires fail to develop, but they will also come to hate their company. Hence, the need to revitalize human management. You don’t have to think in terms of a career. Revitalizing human management means quickly promoting those who have ability or show potential. "

Only those who pair thinking with acting and, what’s more, exert a positive influence over the realization of reflections, will ever be able to manage a company that promotes development."

In fact, the young who are now taking their first tentative steps into the world of industry still have hearts ablaze with the ardent fires of youth and a mind still yearning to learn, have the kind of will to power that can overcome even the harshest climates or the roughest storms.<br />Hence, it is precisely at this malleable state of youth that grand tours of the world should be made, travels to foreign lands undertaken, the climates of the world assessed and humanity itself understood."

		"content":"Foreign scholars seem preoccupied with descriptions of Korean economic growth as ‘the miracle of the Han river,’ but I don’t believe the economy is a place for miracles. To write off this growth as a miracle is a disservice to all citizens who poured out their souls and spirit in toil and passionate efforts to revitalize our country’s economy. The key to this supposed miracle is within them."

Through competition in world markets, our own domestic competitiveness grows.    "

In the world of construction, too, a person in fine fettle and receptive to the concept of thinking can live a fine life, equal to that of ten or a hundred times his status.<br />This is why people who don’t know how to enjoy themselves at a party, who don’t work hard at their jobs and don’t sleep when they’re supposed to are so often criticized."

If you were to ask me why, I could only say the excitement and joy fluttering inside me at the prospect of what is in store that day woke me up then, and continues to wake me up now.<br />Waking up early in the morning is akin to that rush you get, in elementary school, the morning of the day of the school trip.<br />But also, when night comes, I dutifully go to bed, ready for a deep sleep. This is from the desire in me to meet the next day’s sunrise with the joy and energy I need to finish my work. The reason why I can live with such happiness is because I look at the world as a place of beauty, hope – a place for positivity."

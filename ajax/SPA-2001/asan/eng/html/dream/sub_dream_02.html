EPISODE MOVIE 2
Confront the Sky
12,000km through a Typhoon

[Narration]
A man that has left huge footprints in history . 
Every foot step seemed to be a reckless challenge. There is another tale that illustrates his courage. 
That is Asan’s decision to bid against all these companies in advanced countries who were well prepared. He believed that for a construction business to succeed, adventurous information, adventurous attempts and adventurous courage were required. 
After dramatically participating in the bidding processes, a spectacular result was achieved that astonished everyone. From there, his true journey of adventure and challenge began. 

An unprecedented challenge involving a 10 story building-sized structure being transferred by a barge in a severe  typhoon area
A challenge that dared heaven and that nobody would have believed 
Can you keep these tales? 
A bold challenge that was mighty

It is reckless. I disagree. I can do it!

1976
The 20th century’s greatest construction project
Jubail Industrial Harbor of Saudi Arabia.

The supersized construction project
Was a must for all the leading construction companies across the world.

It is reckless.
It is like beating your head against the wall.
We cannot handle it 

I disagree.
We can do it!

The last bid ticket was won dramatically.
The final bid was given to Hyundai of South Korea.
The contract amount was half the national budget.

However

It was impossible.
Due to competitors’ interruptions,
Saudi Arabia did not believe in South Korea.

I disagree.
I can shave 8 months off construction period!

Korea was suffering
From the worst foreign currency rate
Back in those days.
“We need to earn foreign currency.”
Chung Juyung

“Using materials from South Korea
will help the national economy.
Transport all materials by ship from Korea!”
Chung Juyung

12,000km
From Ulsan to Saudi Arabia

35days on the sea
It is reckless. Collisions with other ships.
It is reckless. Barges swept away by typhoons.
It is reckless.  As many as 19 round-trip voyages.

“A man who believes he can do anything will succeed.
If you doubt yourself, you are limiting yourself from achieving your dreams.
If you think you can’t do it, you can’t.”
Chung Juyung
At the construction site for Jubail Industrial Harbor

It is reckless.
I disagree.
We made it!

Accumulated the largest reserve of foreign currency
in the history of the Republic of Korea.

A historical accomplishment
From what seemed at first a reckless challenge.

“Don’t even include the 1% fear
In the winning combination
Of 90% belief that anything
Can be done and 10% confidence
That I can do what I want to 
accomplish”

To those who wish 
To challenge themselves

From a man
With 90% belief
And 10% confidence

EPISODE MOVIE 6
Think Outside the Box
Abundant Sand and Gravel

[Narration]
Have you heard of the story of a dam made of sand and pebbles? 
A miracle that the will be recorded in the history annals of dam construction forever. 

1967
Soyang River Multipurpose Dam.
The then largest dam in Asia.
is still, today, the best known dam in Korea.

[Narration]
The start of the story goes like this. 
The designer of the dam was the world’s leading concrete dam designer from Tokyo University. 
So, Asan had to pay huge money to Japan.

Construction by
Hyundai Construction
vs
Design and technology by
A Japanese company

“Let’s make a concrete gravity dam.”
the Japanese company

But
huge Quantities of reinforced bars and cement had to be imported.

“National facilities paid for by national taxes should be designed and built with the lowest cost and the highest efficiency.”
Chung Juyung

Is there any alternative?

[Narration].
Then, he came upon an idea. 

Sand and Gravel
Abundant in Korea

“How about a rockfill dam made from gravel and sand?”

“Where on earth did you study dam construction?
Don’t be silly.”

[Narration]
Everyone said it was reckless. But, he did not step back. 
Constant disregard and insults from the Japanese company.

After researching the materials used to build dams,
a global consensus was reached.

“Rockfill dam is a world trend.
It works better for our current situation.”

“There was nothing more important than the fact that 
we had the right idea, 
and that it was good our country.”
Chung Juyung

Finally,
They decided to review everything
from the beginning.

The Japanese-designed
Concrete Gravity Dam
vs
Chung Juyung’s proposed
Rockfill Dam

After examining the designs and conducting tests,
the Japanese company admitted
the superiority of Chung Juyung’s proposal.

“A rock bed is weak.
A rockfill dam is safer and more economical.
You were right!”
The Japanese company

[Narration]
Creative thinking that everyone acknowledged in the end. 
The beginning of the Korean construction industry. 

30% of the national budget was saved.
The Rockfill Dam was born.
Much more economical than a gravity dam.
Better suited to Korean topography.

“When you face a crisis of an obstacle,
sticking to the norm, a fixed concept
completely disables and able man.”
Chung Juyung

From an Idea to a Legend
Hidden Stories of South Korea’s Shipbuilding Business, the World’s No.1

[Narration]
Everyone wanted to know.
How did the South Korean shipbuilding manage to become No.1 in the world?
What is its potential?

“An entrepreneur always longs to work
On something new, something greater.
I have always lived
in the pursuit of a ‘greater’ work.”
Chung Juyung

1970
The dawn of heavy industry in South Korea.

He decided to enter into
The shipbuilding industry.

But he was faced with many doubts.
South Korea lacks relevant experience.
It’s too early for the country to construct a huge shipyard.

I disagree!

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
It was that a construction company can produce the ship if it paid a little attention to the relevant industry. 

“Once I make up my mind to do something,
Negative opinions don’t bother me.
As more people holding pessimistic views,
my will to succeed become stronger.”
Chung Juyung
Deciding to enter the shipbuilding industry

There was a bigger problem.
Procuring the huge amount of money necessary for the project.

He went to the UK
to get a loan.

“I can’t be sure of South Korea’s potential.”

“My nation built an armored battleship in the 1500s!”

“Find a ship owner first!”

What he had was just a picture of the desolate sandy beach of Mipo Bay, Ulsan,
a map of the shipyard site,
and a borrowed blueprint of an oil tanker.

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
A picture of a 50,000 sized site, then a picture of a white beach where we said we would build the dockyard. The story is way too heavy, right? 
I brought these pictures and said, if you buy our ship, we will show the contract to the British government for confirmation. Then, I will get confirmation from the Vice-Minister to buy the machinery. Then, a dockyard will be built, and there I will produce your ships. So, buy it. 
That is how the story went. 


[Narration]
A businessman from the east saying he would sell a ship produced from a dockyard that had not even existed yet.

Finally
He received the first order:
Two 260,000-ton oil tankers
from the Greek company Livanos.

He got his loan from the UK.

[Narration]
It was thought that it would take five years to build the dockyard and complete the shipbuilding. 
But, he turned this notion upside down. 

March 23, 1972
The construction of Hyundai Shipyard began.

“There’s no such rule that demands
that the shipyard must be built before ships can be made. ”
Chung Juyung

The concurrent building of a shipyard and a ship.
A first in the history of global shipbuilding.

They expedited the construction work,
Working day and night.
After washing their faces with water from puddles,
They headed straight to the shipyard’s construction site.

[Narration]
He came up with a new idea when he was confronted with obstacles. 

There’s no dock yet!

We should build a ship on land!

“Koreans are people
who can break through any obstacles
with our great willpower once we make up our mind.”
Chung Juyung

700,000 ton shipbuilding ability
600,000 ton building site.

The first phase of shipyard construction was completed.
Two mega oil tankers were built.

1 million ton shipbuilding ability.
1.5 million ton building site.

[Narration]
Then, he finally made it. 
It was the start of the legendary tale of the global No. 1 shipbuilder. 

The largest shipyard in the world.
Leading the shipbuilding industry worldwide.

From Idea to Legend
“Living toady just like yesterday,
or living tomorrow just like today
is not living, but dying.
Each day of your life should be fresh and new.”
Chung Juyung

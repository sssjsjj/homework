EPISODE MOVIE 8
We Are Koreans
Smart, Wise, Warm-hearted and Loving People

The Republic of Korea wants to know

“What miracle made it possible to host the 1988 Olympic Games?”

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
Everyone would have been surprised at the fact that we defeated Japan in a competition. It would be something of a temporal event. But, it was reality. The reality was not a miracle, it was the efforts that made the reality. 

The International Olympic Committee(IOC) Conference was to select the host city
for the 24th Summer Olympic Games.

D-10
At the departure, waiting to board the plane,
everyone was not too optimistic about Korea’s chances for winning the coveted responsibility.

The last all-out war between host nations
Only 10 days left.

Seoul Olympic Committee chief
Chung Juyung

Sincerity and hard work, not only spending money
This ideal united everyone in their efforts.

Flowers delivered to each IOC members
Heartfelt wished from each Korean every morning

A desperate effort to inform them of 
Seoul, the capital of Korea, a divided nation

At last
September 30, 1981
The IOC Conference
Baden-Baden, Germany
The 1988 Olympics host city was announced.

Seoul 52 : Nagoya 27

Korea’s heartfelt diplomacy
touched the hearts of IOC members previously indifferent to Korea.

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
Everyone who was there was in  otal  unity. I was never in a team doing something whether in Korea or overseas. 

The miracle had happened
by holding the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup and the 2012 Yeosu Expo.
The ’88 Seoul Olympics had opened the door for 
Korea to host the world’s three major sporting events

The Republic of Korea wants to know
“Is there any special reason for driving a herd of cattle to North Korea?”

“I wanted to pay back to my father and my hometown.”

A 17-year-old boy who hated poverty and ran away from home.
He took with him the money he had stolen from his father, earned by selling a cow.

[Asan Chung Ju-young]
“Then the one cattle has now been increased to 1,000 cattle to pay back the debt. He then went to visit Sancheon, his hometown where he was only able to go in his night dreams.” 

June 16, 1998
As the first civilian to visit North Korea.
He drove 500 cattle through Panmunjeom.


A gesture of peace recognized by the whole world

“The world’s first civilian cattle diplomacy”
independent, UK

“Very meaningful and symbolic”
CNN, US

“The bridge of South-North compromise by cattle””
Mainichi, Japan

“The last avant garade art of the 20th century”
Guy Sorman, famous civilization critic

It was a critical contribution to the North-South détente
and paved the way for cooperation.

The Republic of Korea wants to know

“What kind of society do you want to live in?”

“Many people who are too poor to buy stock in this country need help.
That’s why I donated 50% of the stock of Hyundai Construction of mine.”
Chung Juyung

1977
He established the Asan Foundation.

“Helping the poorest neighbors in our society.”

In his speech for the 10th anniversary of the Asan Foundation

10 years ago on July 1, 1977, the Asan Foundation was founded.
For ten years, we have built and managed five general hospitals,
providing modern medical treatment services to residents in remote farming and fishing villages.
We have given financial support to social welfare organizations.

Projects to build hospitals all over the country to expand medical services
Free treatment for the poor
Welfare support for underprivileged citizens
Scholarship projects to nurture human resources
Academic research support projects

“I’ll do my best to be recognized when I retire as a man who served the community throughout his life.”

He dreamed of a world full of hope
a society where Koreans would live together in peace and prosperity.

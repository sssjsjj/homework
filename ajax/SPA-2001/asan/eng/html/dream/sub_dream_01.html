EPISODE MOVIE 1
If You Have a Dream
The Prelude of the Legend of South Korea’s Automotive Industry

Day After day, South Korea’s Cars
Accompany lives of people all over the world.

From a latecomer to the automotive industry
to one of the top car producers in the world.

The No.1 car exporter with the biggest trade surplus.
The manufacturer who creates the most jobs.
Hyundai •Kia Automotive Group.

The beginning of a legend
From nothing, the creation of something special.

All eyes are on the future.

“A car is like a national flag running around the streets of cities, the roads of the countryside.
Even though I might not succeed, my efforts will pave a way 
for my descendants to continue the development of the automotive industry.”
Chung Juyung

1940
Art Service Garage
The automobile repair factory

Established 1946
Hyundai Auto Service Center

“The root of ‘Hyundai’ is car service.
I have considered manufacturing cars to be my life’s work since when I was young.
It seemed essential to succeed in the automotive industry in order to develop the Korean economy”
Chung Juyung

A country underdeveloped for entering the automotive industry,
South Korea was a wasteland, void of technology till the 1960s.

“Once we miss the chance,
It is not easy to enter in the automotive business again.”
Chung Juyung

Established December 1967
Hyundai Motor Company

Within just six months after factory construction,
Assembly production and sales of the Ford Cortina began.

But
It’s performance and parts were unsuitable
for the old roads of those days.

Sales decreased sharply
And a great flood hit the factory.

The project was half success, half failure.

Chung Juyung’s new breakthrough.

“To succeed in the automotive industry, what’s important is not assembling,
But acquiring advanced manufacturing technology and exports.”
Chung Juyung

He initiated the establishment of 
a joint-venture company with Ford.

But negotiations went south,
Keeping the Korean automotive industry in check.

“The world market is Ford’s, not Hyundai’s”
VS
“Hyundai is not Ford’s subcontractor!”

Chung Juyung’s resolution.

Independence in technology and production.

“Failure is OK. Let’s just do what we want!”

It was an attempt that Taiwan,
More technologically advanced than Korea at the time,
had never dared to make.

With Korean workers and Korean technology,
He pushed to develop a unique model.

[Narration]
Korea does not have to be frustrated at the fact that it is starting at a relatively later time. We do not have to be anxious about the fact that we need to catch up with the fast runners. We do not have to chase after them, but we just need to start at the point where they currently are at a surprisingly fast speed. 
That is why we do not have to worry about the huge gap.

“We don’t’ have to be disappointed by the fact that we are behind the U.S. and Japan.
We are not following their path.
Rather, we are starting by building on their achievements.”
Chung Juyung

Finally
June 1974

The first unique domestic model
Pony was developed!

A general auto factory was constructed,
And the production of Pony began in earnest.

The Republic of Korea joined the ranks of nations who produced their own cars.
Korea was the 2nd in Asia and the 16th in the world.

We continued progress for technological independence
Despite market leaders’ attempts to keep us in check.

1985
The South Korea’s first front-wheel drive(FWD) Pony Excel came to the world market.

And was exported to the U.S.
Home of the automotive industry.

1991
The first national car engine, the Alpha Engine,
was successfully developed independently.

We spend up the development of domestically-produced engines.
1995 Beta Engine
1997 Upsilon Engine	
1998 Delta Engine

Then
Act 2 of the South Korean automotive industry.

1998
A decision to take over Kia was made.
Right in the midst of the Asian financial crisis.

Suddenly, the South Korean automotive industry saw greater economies of scale.
Global growth increased exponentially.

From a South Korean car to a global car.

A legend of the South Korean automotive industry.

It was Chung Juyung’s message that opened up the prelude to the legend.

Never stop chasing after your dreams.
